ROUTE GUIDANCE PROTOCOL [VANETS]
====================================

SCOPE
=====

The aim of this project is to automatically guide a driver of a vehicle to
travel from one place to another in a city through a decentralized solution with
no infrastructure requirements. The system makes use of the current state of
traffic on the roads by enabling communication between vehicles. The traffic
information is obtained dynamically and the system will guide the driver in a
route based on his preferences. The goal of the system is to:

• Provide an effective communication mechanism between vehicles

• Compute a path which takes into account both the distance as well as the
time

• Take into account the movement/change in traffic during the journey of
a vehicle by recalculating the efficient path before approaching every
junction

• Minimize packets sent in the network by making vehicles respond only to
vehicles for which they have relevant information.

CONRIBUTIONS
============

The contributions of this project are threefold. First, it creates a real time
test bed for evaluating any route guidance mechanism. Second, it evaluates the
performance of weight based cost function on real time traffic scenarios. Third,
based on the findings from evaluation, it identifies the open issues and possible ways to address them.
